### Git: General commands

Git: a version control system ..

<b>1.</b> -- pull vs fetch vs merge:

`Git Pull`: perform as a fetch additionally merge changes into your local branch  
(`git pull = git fetch + git merge`)

`Git Fetch`: download any changes to local except for local branch (local branch stay unchanged)

`Git Rebase`: rewrite the changes of one branch onto another without creating a new commit

`Git Merge`: merge changes from remote to local

<b>2.</b> -- git pull vs git pull rebase:

`git pull = git fetch + git merge`

`git pull --rebase = git fetch + git rebase`

<!-- this is something to recall quickly: https://github.com/twtrubiks/Git-Tutorials -->

Common usage: `git pull --rebase`, providing more cleaner and won't impose a `logical grouping` on your commits

Simple word: `git pull --rebase` made `code reviewer` life much easier to review the commits

**_ after git rebase, if we have conflicts, we normally `git add .` + `git rebase --continue` + `git push` _**

<b>3.</b> -- git push commands:

```js
-u: `-u` means `--set-upstream`, eg: `git push -u origin master`
```

`git push origin HEAD`: A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote.

`git push origin HEAD:master`: Push the current branch to the remote ref matching master in the origin repository. This form is convenient to push the current branch without thinking about its local name.

<b>4.</b> -- How to combine old commits into 1 commit before merge (Equivalent with `Squash`):

```js
`git reset --soft the-commit-hash-before-the-first-commit-for-this-branch`;
```

Then, do `git push -f` to update code for that branch

<b>5.</b> -- `git push --force-with-lease`:

it helps developers to double check whether someone has already push something, (try to avoid overwrite other developer's code)

<b>6.</b> -- `git cherry-pick`:

When to use:

Case 1: when we want to pick up specific commit from one branch (original/source) instead of all commit and paste commit to a new branch (destination)

Case 2: when we push our code into a wrong branch, we want to put the commit into a correct branch

Branch A has 3 commits, Branch B has 6 commits, and we only need Branch B second commit and put into Branch A, this is story case, we can use `cherry-pick` command in `Branch A`. After the cherry-pick, the commit which get cherry picked will be set as the `topest/latest` commit for Branch A.

If we cherry pick multiple files (this is the command): `git cherry-pick #hash-1 #hash-2`
If we have conflicts during cherry pick, so we `first` resolve the conflicts and then use `git cherry-pick --continue`

<b>7.</b> -- git revert vs git reset:

**_ danger level: checkout -> revert -> reset _**

git revert: delete the `specific` commit from commit chains, just don't want this specific commit

git reset: reset to a specific spot of previous commit, it deletes a range of commits

#commit-1 -> #commit-2 -> #commit-3 -> #commit-4

- For git revert, we can revert #commit-3, so #commit-3 will be `deleted` and behaves as `never added before`, and it will add a new `REVERT-hash-commit` as latest commit instead of delete the commit which needs to be reverted !!!! Again, if we want to change back, we can revert the `REVERT-hash-commit`, so we changed back !!

- For git reset, we can reset #commit-2 as `HEAD`, so, #commit-3 and #commit-4 are removed forever

<b>8.</b> -- git logs:

- `git reflog`
- `git log --oneline`
- `git log`
- `git diff`
- `git show #hash-commit`

<b>9.</b> --track (Git command):

git command --track is for fetching remote branch into local

When we donâ€™t have the local branch and we can run this command to checkout the branch and fetch that branch into your local codebase:

Eg: git checkout --track origin/feature/sample-pos-two

<b>10.</b> git rebase process commands:

```
git checkout master (target-branch)
git pull
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase master // also need to fix merge issues / conflicts after run this command
git rebase --continue
git rebase --abort // if not happy with rebase changes
git push -f
```

<b>11.</b> git branch rename:

```
// assume you were not in your current branch:
git branch -m oldName newName
// assume you were inside your current branch
git branch -m newName
```

<b>12.</b> `git add -A`

- add everything in your current repo even you were inside the sub-folder

<b>13.</b> `git config --global alias.ac '!git add -A && git commit -m'`

- used for setup global commit. Then we can type git ac "commit message"

<b>14.</b> `git describe --always --tag --long`

- used for get the latest master branch commit hash code of your current codebase [Give it a shot, then you know better]

<b>15.</b> `git revert commit-hash`: revert means not going to delete the commit, just create a new commit which revert back to before current target revert commit.

For example: we need to revert to commit-3 (commit-1, commit-2, commit-3).
So now, we do `git revert commit-3-hash-code`
Then we can see now, we have a new commit (commit-4), which is exactly same as commit-2 !!

`git revert HEAD`: it means undo the most recent commit !!

<b>16.</b> `git reflog`: we can see the history of git logs

<b>17.</b> `git branch -vv`: give details about the branch

<b>18.</b> `git remote update --prune`: remove the remote branch reference if the branch no longer exists in the remote repository.

Example:

```
Step 1: `git remote update --prune`
Step 2: `git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' xargs git branch -d`

awk : is used for search certain text
/: gone]/ : means find keyword 'gone'
print $1 : means print out the first result
xargs : means read the input data which the research result of (awk '/: gone]/{print $1}')
```

<b>19.</b> `git reset --hard origin/branch_name`: just re-pull the remote branch ("branch_name") code and wipe out all local changes, super dangerous !!

<b>20.</b> `git commit --amend --no-edit`: overwrite current commit without creating a new commit

- The pre-condition for running this command is `you already open a PR in remote git server`

<b>21.</b> `git revert -m 1 <already-committed-hash>`: its used for reverting back already merged commit. The example case: `I made a mistake to accidentally merge code into master branch and I want to revert back for master branch ..`

```js
1. git checkout -b revert-merge // branch out from master branch !!
2. git revert -m 1 <already-committed-hash>
3. git commit -m "revert merge fix"
4. git push // Then ask for review

```

<b>22.</b> Git rename the file from lowercase to uppercase

in the current branch, it can be done by: `git mv OLD_FOLDER NEW_FOLDER` ensure all files are renamed instead of deleted !!!

<b>23.</b> Git checkout to a branch you forgot the full name

git checkout `git branch | grep branch-name-you-can-remember`
