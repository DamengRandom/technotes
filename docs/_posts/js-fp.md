### Functional programming:

#### Concept

- some people treated functional programming as pure functions (pure function will not have any side effects).
- it's a style of coding, similar with oop. It's just a mindset of coding !!
- supported languages like scala, js, haskell and etc
- programs as a function !! (What should my function take in, and what my functions will return out)
- avoid side effects (do nothing but return output based on nothing but input !!!!)
